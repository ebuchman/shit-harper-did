<h1>Shit Harper Did</h1>

<p>Stephen Harper is a corrupt, anti-democratic politician that is destroying the Canadian identity as a peace-keeper, environmental steward, and champion of human rights.</p>

<p>He is weakening our democracy, sabotaging our future, and ruining our international reputation.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Harper is the first, in history, among leaders of the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations, to be found in contempt of parliament.</p></li>

<li><p>Harper has been found guilty of repeated election scandals; so he has passed legislation to weaken oversight of the election process and to make
it more difficult for people (particularly his opposers) to vote.</p></li>

<li><p>Harper shut down parliament twice when he felt threatened, and his party released a 200-page &quot;Obstruction Handbook&quot; on how to interfere with and inhibit the democratic process in parliamentary committees.</p></li>

<li><p>Harper is censoring scientists, controlling their communication with the media, and forcing them to make changes in their reports for non-scientific reasons.</p></li>

<li><p>Harper has dismantled Canada's Peace-Keeping Force, taking it from 1st in the world to 68th. Meanwhile, Haper bungled <em>tens of billions</em> of dollars buying fighter jets.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any one of these facts should be sufficient indication that this is not the man to be leading canada. Below are many more.</p>

They tried to block the court case by calling it frivolous, paying for lawyers with taxpayers money.

Some of the worst offenders were personally appointed by Harper. One conservative MP (Nigel Wright) tried to cover up the expenses of another (Mike Duffy) to the tune of $90,000 - this is illegal.
