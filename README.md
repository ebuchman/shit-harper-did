# Shit Harper Did

The following is a list of reasons why Stephan Harper is Canada' worst Prime Minister.

He is a corrupt, anti-democratic, virtually fascist politician that is destroying the Canadian identity and sabotaging our future.

Let's collect all the evidence here and use this repository to inform others and provide key talking points for educating the public
about this destructive government.

Corruption
----------

- [In and Out scandal (2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_and_Out_scandal) - "the Conservative Party of Canada and its fundraising arm pleaded guilty to exceeding election spending limits and submitting fraudulent election records, and agreed to repay $230,198.00 for its role in violating Canadian election spending laws"

- [Contempt of Parliament (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Parliament#Contempt_citation_cases_for_governments) - "The contempt finding is unique in Canadian history. In a wider context, it is the first time that a government in the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations, Commonwealth Realm or Parliamentary republic alike, has been found in contempt of Parliament"

- [Robocalling (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canadian_federal_election_voter_suppression_scandal) - Fraudulent and misleading calls were made to voters announcing false polling stations to supress votes.

- [Senate Spending Scandal (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Senate_expenses_scandal) - [hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of inappropriate expenses were filed by the 30 Senators](http://globalnews.ca/news/568714/a-look-at-key-dates-in-the-evolution-of-the-senate-expense-claim-controversy/). Some of the worst offenders were personally appointed by Harper. One conservative MP (Nigel Wright) tried to cover up the expenses of another (Mike Duffy) to the tune of $90,000 - this is illegal. Harper initially defended the senators, but then decided to blame them.

- [F35 scandal (2012)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fighter-jet-plan-reset-as-f-35-costs-soar-1.1203373) - Harper government committed to buy F35 fighter jets (without even considering competing jets), claiming it would cost only $9 billion over 20 years. Parliamentary Budget Officer (Kevin Page) reported it would actually cost over $30 billion, and he was scorned. A Department of National Defence report vindicated Page by estimating the costs at over $40 billion over 40 years.

- [Donations scandal (2013)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-penashue-campaign-took-in-28-ineligible-contributions-1.1313425) - Conservative cabinet minister Peter Penashue overspent his election limit and accepted a corporate donation, which is illegal under Canadian law.

- [Appointing ineligible Justice Marc Nadon to supreme court (2013)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/marc-nadon-s-failed-journey-to-the-supreme-court-1.2636403) - Haper knowingly appointed an ineligible judge to the supreme court. The appointment was challenged and overturned.

- [Taxpayer funded political ads (ongoing)](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/federal-ad-spending-exceeds-projections/article16503725/) - tens of millions of dollars a year are spent on ads for the conservative party.

Anti-Democracy
--------------

- [Federal Accountability Act (2006)](http://www.dwatch.ca/camp/RelsDec1710.html) - "Overall, the Conservatives' FAA and other decisions have increased government accountability or attempted to increase accountability in 29 ways ... However, the Conservatives have also weakened government accountability in eight ways, and failed to keep 29 promises". The conservatives rejected proposed changes and have ignored 100 other loopholes in the government's accountability system.

- [Proroguing Parliament 4 times (2008-2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prorogation_in_Canada#History) - Harper shut down parliament four times because he felt threatened.

- [Omnibus bills (ongoing)](http://www.macleans.ca/politics/how-sprawling-budget-bills-threaten-parliamentary-democracy/) - Harper is a fan of bills which introduce many sweeping changes to Canadian laws all at once, inhibitting the ability of MPs to vote on particular aspects of the bills, or to even review them competently (given their enormous breadth and scope). [They are an affront to our democracy](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2012/10/19/omnibus_budget_bill_c45_is_an_affront_to_democracy.html)

- [Fair Elections Act (2014)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Elections_Act#Criticism) - weakened Elections Canada, muzzled chief electoral officer from communicating about investigations, cut off the investigation's arm, changed polling supervisors to be appointed by the current party (rather than Elections Canada), and made it harder for lower-class individuals to vote.

- [Gagging Scientists (ongoing)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/muzzling-of-federal-scientists-widespread-survey-suggests-1.2128859) - the Harper Government is systematically gagging scientists, particularly environmental scientists. They are not allowed to speak freely with the media about their research (publicly fundeded research) and [some have even been required to be escorted by government liasons at conferences](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/federal-scientists-closely-monitored-during-polar-conference-1.1248559). [The world leading science journal Nature published a condemnation of the practice](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7387/full/483006a.html)

- Auditing environmental and civil society groups. Costs $13-million a year; Seven environmental groups, anti-poverty, foreign aid and human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, as well as the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and United Church of Canada. No conservative think tanks have been audited.Canada

- [Secret FIPA Agreement ()](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/10/17/canada-china-fipa-critics-flawed_n_1975149.html) - The Foreign Investment Promotion and Protectionact, which [allows Chinese companies to sue Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/5-things-to-know-about-the-canada-china-investment-treaty-1.1183343) if they feel they are being treated differently than Canadian companies.
