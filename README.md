# Shit Harper Did

The following is a list of reasons why Stephan Harper is Canada' worst Prime Minister.

He is a corrupt, anti-democratic politician that is destroying the Canadian identity as a peace-keeper, environmental steward, and champion of human rights.

He is weakening our democracy, sabotaging our future, and ruining our international reputation.

Let's collect all the evidence here and use this repository to inform others and provide key talking points for educating the public
about this destructive government.

Highlights
----------

- Harper is the first, in history, among leaders of the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations to be found in contempt of parliament.

- Harper has suffered from repeated election scandals and has passed legislation to weaken oversight of the election process and to make
it more difficult for people to vote.

- Harper shut down parliament twice when he felt threatened, and his party released an "Obstruction Handbook" on how to inhibit the democratic process in parliament.

- Harper is censoring scientists.

- Harper has taken Canada's Peace-Keeping Force from 1st in the world to 68th. Meanwhile, Haper bungled tens of billions of dollars buying fighter jets.

Any one of these facts should be sufficient indication that this is not the man to be leading canada. Below are many more.

Corruption
----------

- [In and Out scandal (2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_and_Out_scandal) - "the Conservative Party of Canada and its fundraising arm pleaded guilty to exceeding election spending limits and submitting fraudulent election records, and agreed to repay $230,198.00 for its role in violating Canadian election spending laws"

- [Contempt of Parliament (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Parliament#Contempt_citation_cases_for_governments) - "The contempt finding is unique in Canadian history. In a wider context, it is the first time that a government in the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations, Commonwealth Realm or Parliamentary republic alike, has been found in contempt of Parliament"

- [Robocalling (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canadian_federal_election_voter_suppression_scandal) - Fraudulent and misleading calls were made to voters announcing false polling stations to supress votes.

- [Senate Spending Scandal (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Senate_expenses_scandal) - [hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of inappropriate expenses were filed by the 30 Senators](http://globalnews.ca/news/568714/a-look-at-key-dates-in-the-evolution-of-the-senate-expense-claim-controversy/). Some of the worst offenders were personally appointed by Harper. One conservative MP (Nigel Wright) tried to cover up the expenses of another (Mike Duffy) to the tune of $90,000 - this is illegal. Harper initially defended the senators, but then decided to blame them.

- [F35 scandal (2012)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fighter-jet-plan-reset-as-f-35-costs-soar-1.1203373) - Harper government committed to buy F35 fighter jets (without even considering competing jets), claiming it would cost only $9 billion over 20 years. Parliamentary Budget Officer (Kevin Page) reported it would actually cost over $30 billion, and he was scorned. A Department of National Defence report vindicated Page by estimating the costs at over $40 billion over 40 years.

- [Donations scandal (2013)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-penashue-campaign-took-in-28-ineligible-contributions-1.1313425) - Conservative cabinet minister Peter Penashue overspent his election limit and accepted a corporate donation, which is illegal under Canadian law.

- [Taxpayer funded political ads (ongoing)](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/federal-ad-spending-exceeds-projections/article16503725/) - tens of millions of dollars a year are spent on ads for the conservative party.

- [Fair Elections Act (2014)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Elections_Act#Criticism) - weakened Elections Canada, muzzled chief electoral officer from communicating about investigations, cut off the investigation's arm, changed polling supervisors to be appointed by the current party (rather than Elections Canada), and made it harder for hundreds of thousands of individuals to vote due to changed voter-identification rules.

- [Omnibus bills (ongoing)](http://www.macleans.ca/politics/how-sprawling-budget-bills-threaten-parliamentary-democracy/) - Harper is a fan of bills which introduce many sweeping changes to Canadian laws all at once, inhibitting the ability of MPs to vote on particular aspects of the bills, or to even review them competently (given their enormous breadth and scope).
