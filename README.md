The following is a list of reasons why Stephan Harper is Canada' worst Prime Minister.

He is a corrupt, anti-democratic, virtually fascist politician that is destroying the Canadian identity and sabotaging our future.

Let's collect all the evidence here and use this repository to inform others and provide key talking points for educating the public
about this destructive government.

Corruption
----------

- [In and Out scandal (2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_and_Out_scandal) - "the Conservative Party of Canada and its fundraising arm pleaded guilty to exceeding election spending limits and submitting fraudulent election records, and agreed to repay $230,198.00 for its role in violating Canadian election spending laws"

- [Contempt of Parliament (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Parliament#Contempt_citation_cases_for_governments) - "The contempt finding is unique in Canadian history. In a wider context, it is the first time that a government in the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations, Commonwealth Realm or Parliamentary republic alike, has been found in contempt of Parliament"

- [Robocalling (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canadian_federal_election_voter_suppression_scandal) - Fraudulent and misleading calls were made to voters announcing false polling stations to supress votes.

- [Senate Spending Scandal (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Senate_expenses_scandal) - [hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of inappropriate expenses were filed by the 30 Senators](http://globalnews.ca/news/568714/a-look-at-key-dates-in-the-evolution-of-the-senate-expense-claim-controversy/). Some of the worst offenders were personally appointed by Harper. One conservative MP (Nigel Wright) tried to cover up the expenses of another (Mike Duffy) to the tune of $90,000 - this is illegal. Harper initially defended the senators, but then decided to blame them.

- [F35 scandal (2012)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fighter-jet-plan-reset-as-f-35-costs-soar-1.1203373) - Harper government committed to buy F35 fighter jets (without even considering competing jets), claiming it would cost only $9 billion over 20 years. Parliamentary Budget Officer (Kevin Page) reported it would actually cost over $30 billion, and he was scorned. A Department of National Defence report vindicated Page by estimating the costs at over $40 billion over 40 years.

- [Donations scandal (2013)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-penashue-campaign-took-in-28-ineligible-contributions-1.1313425) - Conservative cabinet minister Peter Penashue overspent his election limit and accepted a corporate donation, which is illegal under Canadian law.

- [Appointing ineligible Justice Marc Nadon to supreme court (2013)](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/marc-nadon-s-failed-journey-to-the-supreme-court-1.2636403) - Haper knowingly appointent and ineligible judge to the supreme court. The appointment was challenged and overturned.

- [Taxpayer funded political ads (ongoing)](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/federal-ad-spending-exceeds-projections/article16503725/) - 10s of millions of dollars a year are spent on ads for the conservative party.
